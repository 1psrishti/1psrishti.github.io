            </br>
                <p>Personal development has been growing in popularity within the last couple of years. Whether it’s books, podcasts, or inspirational documentaries, people are seeking a better understanding of who they are and how they can improve their life. A huge part of this personal growth movement is self-discovery.</p>
            </br>
                <p>Traditionally, self-discovery is simply known as discovering something about yourself, which is easy enough to understand. Most people associate self-discovery with taking a personality test or doing some soul searching to figure out your dream career.</p>
            </br>
                <p>However, self-discovery goes way beyond just finding out your personality type or your perfect job. In fact, self-discovery is almost every aspect of personal development.</p>
            </br>
                <p>Some of the aspects of self-discovery:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Discovering your passions</li>
                    <li>Figuring out your purpose</li>
                    <li>Finding out what motivates you</li>

                    <h2>Attitude</h2>
                <p class="firstp">The definition of an attitude is a way of feeling or acting toward a person, thing or situation. Passion for a sport, dislike for a certain actor and negativity toward life in general are each an example of an attitude.</p>
            </br>
                <p>Evaluate your current attitude.
                What attitudes make you feel most negative about yourself?
                What actions create conflict between you and others?
                What thoughts cloud or control your mind?</p>
            </br>    
                <p>If you were trying to motivate other people, you’d pump them up, wouldn’t you? You’d offer words of support, encouragement and inspiration.</p>
            </br>    
                <p>Do you do the same for yourself?</p>
            </br>        
                <p>I can’t. I doubt. I don’t think. I don’t have the time. I’m afraid. I don’t believe.</p>
            </br>    
                <p>This self-doubt darkens our attitudes, limits our success and casts a shadow over our lives. The fix is easy: Change the language. I can. I expect the best. I know. I’ll make the time. I am confident. I believe.</p>
            </br>    
                <p>Rewire your thought patterns. Our feelings come from our thoughts. We can change them by changing our thought patterns. It’s our thoughts, not our circumstances, that determine our happiness. </p>

                <p>Whenever you feel down, play this game. Ask yourself a 'why' question, answer it, and then ask another connected 'why' question to yourself.</p></br>
                <p>Why do I hate my job? Because I feel tired all day. </br>Why do I feel tired at the office all day? Because the air is really bad.</br> Why is the air really bad? Because we never open a window.</p>

                <p class="lsubh">Turn your opinions and thoughts into questions.</p></br>
                <p>This activity can help reduce negativity from your life. Whenever you make negative opinion about someone or something, simply turn that opinion into a question by adding a question-mark at the end of it.</p></br>
                <p>So instead of thinking "I'm bad at maths." think "I'm bad at maths?"</br>Instead of thinking "Brandon is an idiot." think "Brandon is an idiot?"</p>
